# Development

## Technical Requirements

You'll need to have some basic programming experience with the technologies and tools we use.

### Tools

* **Git & GitHub** - Clone, commit and open a PR using Git and GitHub. Check out the following tutorials:

  * [Introduction to git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61/)

### Tech Stack

Projects under the Codeuino Community are primarily **JavaScript** based and leverage several frameworks and libraries. In all of the projects, **React** is used on the frontend and the backend is written in **Node.js** with **Express** framework. **MongoDB** and **Redis** are used for persistent and in-memory storage respectively. **Socket.IO** is used for notifications using WebSockets. Some projects also use GraphQL. Apart from these various npm packages are used in different projects.

We recommend having good understanding of JavaScript basics like Promises, Async/await, ES6 etc and at least some experience working with Node/Express, React and MongoDB to get started. Check out these free resources to sharpen your tech skills:
