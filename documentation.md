# Documentation

So you're thinking of contributing to our documentation? Amazing! We really appreciate contributing to the docs because documentation plays an important role in any open source project to get started. So in order to chime in see something that needs fixing, or something that could be improved. Below you'll find some helpful guidelines to get you started, and to familiarize you with the approach we have been trying to follow.

NOTE: Our documentaion is located and hosted on Gitbook. Link to the documentation - [**docs.codeuino.org**](https://docs.codeuino.og)\*\*\*\*

In general, there are two main types of contributions:

* **General improvements**: typo corrections, fixing broken refs or links, correcting inaccurate or out-of-date information, and offering better explanations through clearer writing and additional examples.
* **New features or new pages**: Adding a page of documentation that we haven't yet covered in our ongoing rewrite attempts as we move platforms, or documenting a new feature that has been added to Codeuino Projects since the last release.
