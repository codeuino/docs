## URL Shortner:

**Summary:**  
This URL shortner is going to be same as any other URL shortner service out there. 

**Detailed Info:**  
We need a URL shortner\[1\] for Donut platform which will shorten the URL pasted anywhere in the platform. Suppose if a user is making a post and he adds an external URL to the post, this external URL should be shortened and will replace the original URL after user submits the post.   
This process of shortening should execute automatically as soon as the user makes a post with external URL or if a user in comments uses an external URL.  
Also, if a user uses a URL  from the Donut platform itself event that needs to be shortened.
