The person who is willing to mentor takes up the project within the community and propose it under GSoD on the basis of involvement and prior knowledge of tech writing in it.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week \(more at the start, less at the end\). In return, a student works on your project full time for 3 months. Think about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but could not find the time.

4. **Review student proposals** and work with other mentors and organization admins to select the best candidates for Codeuino.
5. **Ensure your Student is Active.** They should have a good community involvement and good discussions. Should be answerable wherever they are tagged.
6. **Reach out to the Season of Docs organization administrators** if you have questions or concerns.
