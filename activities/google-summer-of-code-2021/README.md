# Google-Summer-Of-Code-2021

## **Welcome to the Google Summer of Code 2021** <a id="welcome-to-the-google-summer-of-code-2020"></a>

​[**Google Summer of Code**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program which encourages university students aged 18 or over to participate with open source projects during their summer vacations from schools and gain exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits by drilling up their skills.

Google awards stipends, to all successful students who complete their free and open-source projects under [**Codeuino**](http://www.codeuino.org/). Alongside Codeuino community members volunteer as "mentors" to students, who assist them about their summer projects and succeed their projects in an expected way.

To learn more about this year's event and how GSoC works, please refer to the [**Frequently Asked Question \(FAQ\)**](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

Potential mentors are invited to assign themselves on the projects they want to mentor this summer under Codeuino community.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week \(more at the start, less at the end\). In return, a student works on your project full time for 3 months. Think about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but could not find the time.

Consider proposing your own ideas that match the community project style.

Make sure you get through the followings:
