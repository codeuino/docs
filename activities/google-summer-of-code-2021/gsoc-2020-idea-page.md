# GSoC 2021 Idea Page

**Welcome to our Google Summer of Code 2021 ideas page. As a student, you are welcome to pick any of the ideas listed below and start early in the community bonding process as well as learning a bit about our code if we get selected as a mentoring organization. And of course, we'd love you to stay around even if we are not invited to GSoC or if we cannot invite you as a student.**

Students can connect with the Org Admins, Mentors, and other community members through various communication channels given below:

* **Email:** [**Jaskirat Singh**](mailto:juskirat2000@gmail.com) and **Siddharth Simharaju** **\(Org Admins\)**  


  Students and Mentors can join the slack discussion portal in order to carry discussions about their projects and interaction within the community.  

* **Slack Workplace** - [**http://slack.codeuino.org/**](http://slack.codeuino.org/)\*\*\*\*

All tasks on this page already indicate mentors for the task. New tasks on this page should be added only by those with the experience and time to invest in mentoring new developers.
