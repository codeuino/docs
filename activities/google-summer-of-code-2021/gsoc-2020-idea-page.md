# GSoC 2021 Idea Page

**Welcome to our Google Summer of Code 2021 ideas page. As a student, you are welcome to pick any of the ideas listed below and start early in the community bonding process as well as learning a bit about our code if we get selected as a mentoring organization. And of course, we'd love you to stay around even if we are not invited to GSoC or if we cannot invite you as a student.**

Students can connect with the Org Admins, Mentors, and other community members through various communication channels given below:

* **Email:** **Jaskirat Singh** and **Siddharth Simharaju** **\(Org Admins\)**  


  Students and Mentors can join the slack discussion portal in order to carry discussions about their projects and interaction within the community.  

* **Slack Workplace** - [**http://slack.codeuino.org/**](http://slack.codeuino.org/)\*\*\*\*

All tasks on this page already indicate mentors for the task. New tasks on this page should be added only by those with the experience and time to invest in mentoring new developers.

**Make sure to Check out** [**Google Summer of Code 2021**](https://docs.codeuino.org/documentation/activities/google-summer-of-code-2021) **to know more about community participation in GSoC 2021.**

## **IDEA 1: Refactoring and Improving Donut Platform Interaction**

### **Priority:**

High

### Description:

Donut is an open-source, feature-rich, highly flexible and privacy-friendly, social networking platform built for community-oriented collaboration in a customized way. It has been transitioning from development to a production phase, with a vision to have better scalability but it is required to evaluate through various testing, documentation and elimination of all major level bugs which will allow an essential impetus to provide custom and friendly rich widgets and an expansive library of modules to make communication and collaboration easy and successful. So, it is required to refactor the whole existing codebase in order to build the powerful module system along with adding some minor features.

Few major directed points that need to be accomplished are:

* Maintaining design consistency across the whole application
