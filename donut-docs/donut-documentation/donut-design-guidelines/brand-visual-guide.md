### Introduction

This document will guide you through the basic visual communications developed for the Donut platform's brand identity. It serves as a collection of visual components and rules to convey a range of expressions.

Donut’s identity is formed by the brandmark, color, typography and composition. Together, this system of core elements creates a consistent visual language for the platform.
